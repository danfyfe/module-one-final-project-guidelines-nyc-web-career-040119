## Thanks for checking out our CLI App!

*A quick hello from Sarah and Dan:*

We're excited to share with you our very first CLI app, Hempirical. Hempiricial is a humble app that uses The Strain API (http://strains.evanbusse.com/index.html) to access information regarding different strains of marijuana for medical purposes.

The functionality is simple: A User can search through the various strains by name, species, and/or medical symptom and add any strain to their stash. The User can also view their stash as well as add or remove any strain they like.


### Installation

1. **Migrate:**  

    Run '*rake db:migrate*' from terminal while inside the top directory

2. **Seed:**

    Run '*ruby db/seed.rb*' in terminal

    This will populate the database with The Strain API data

3. **Run the App**  

    Run '*ruby bin/run.rb*' in terminal
